### Hello, I'm [João Victor Palhares Barbosa Avanzini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-avanzini/)! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

João Victor is a master's student at the State University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/)), at the Institute of Computing ([IC](https://ic.unicamp.br/)), a scientific researcher member of the laboratory REasoning for COmplex Data ([Recod.ai](https://recod.ai/)). His emphasis is on the use of models of Deep Learning such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in the medical field to estimate blood pressure and detect brain anomalies.

As a professional collaborator of the company [Compass UOL](https://compass.uol/), João Victor is a computer vision team leader at the Cognitive Computing Innovation Studio and uses his skills to manage teams and instruct them to solve problems as best as possible.

Computer Technician Degree at College of Limeira of The State University of Campinas ([COTIL-UNICAMP](https://www.cotil.unicamp.br/)), and Industrial Mechatronics Technology major at Arthur de Azevedo Technological Faculty ([FATEC Mogi Mirim](https://fatecmm.edu.br/)).

Particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence for Medical data, Cognitive Computer Solutions, Robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Guided Vehicles, and Chatbots.

If you thought the absence/addition of the last name seemed weird, it was because it was just corrected. The right spelling is Avanzini at the end of my surname.
