### Hello, I'm [Jo√£o Victor Palhares Barbosa Avanzini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-avanzini/)! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

I am an **AI and Data Science specialist** dedicated to building intelligent, scalable systems that solve complex business challenges. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from one of Latin America's top universities and a proven track record in both corporate and research environments, I bridge the gap between theoretical innovation and practical, high-impact applications.

My passion lies in transforming data into actionable insights and robust AI-powered products. Whether it's architecting enterprise-grade data pipelines, leading computer vision teams, or developing sophisticated NLP models, I thrive on creating solutions that drive efficiency and growth.

### Professional Expertise

My work is focused on three core areas where I deliver tangible value:

* **Data Engineering & Cloud Architecture** <br>
    I design and implement resilient, automated ETL pipelines for large-scale data processing. My expertise includes building data workflows on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, utilizing services like BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and Pub/Sub to ensure data is clean, harmonized, and ready for advanced analytics and machine learning applications.

* **Computer Vision** <br>
    As a former Computer Vision Team Leader, I have hands-on experience taking projects from concept to deployment. I have successfully implemented solutions like real-time object detection with **YOLOv8** for industrial applications, automated document analysis with **OCR**, and developed novel systems for ergonomic posture analysis that gained significant industry attention.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** <br>
    I build and scale conversational AI solutions that enhance user engagement. A key project involved leading the migration of enterprise chatbots for **PagSeguro PagBank** to a RASA/Python stack, engineering a microservices architecture designed to support millions of daily interactions.

### Academic Foundations & Research

My practical skills are built on a strong academic foundation in artificial intelligence from the **State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)**, where my research is recognized by the international community.

* **Master's Thesis:** My thesis, "[*Exploring representation learning on electrocardiogram signals*](https://www.repositorio.unicamp.br/Acervo/Detalhe/1503481)", was accepted and published, showcasing my ability to conduct rigorous scientific inquiry.
* **International Recognition:** I have been invited to present my research at prestigious international conferences, including the **International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)** and the **KHIPU Latin American Meeting in AI**.
